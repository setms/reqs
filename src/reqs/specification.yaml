context: |
  Requirements are fundamental to software development.
  Requirements management tools aren't used often because they're expensive, poorly integrated with other development
  tools, or both.
vision: |
  The `setms-reqs` project delivers tools for maintaining light-weight but rigorous requirements.
  It meets developers where they are in terms of integrating into their workbench of tools and ways of working.
  At the same time, it enforces good requirements engineering practices.
